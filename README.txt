Hello, I'm a web3 and defi enthusiast. I found your project a few days ago. I carefully read about kostren on twitter, website and doc The description of many new mechanisms of finance, especially the $KTN model uses the negative empirical bonding curve. I like this feature very much because it combines with the existing mint mechanism to provide arbitrage space. I believe it will attract users to use your product.
However, I have some programming knowledge, and I see a potential vulnerability in your "KTN Bond" contract (2073-2110 lines), which is related to the recently launched friend invitation mechanism. This invitation mechanism has no limit on the number of invitations and the maximum reward. I can understand that this is to attract more users. But it also provides a possibility for the lightning loan attack. On June 25, 2021, a project named "xWin. FINANCE" was also used as an invitation mechanism to drain all the liquidity in Uniswap. Suppose there is a large amount of money (no more than the set 5000000 dollars) to cast KTN coins, and use the invitation mechanism to reward yourself, and then sell all available KTN into currency such as USDC, then it is equivalent to that all USDCs in KTN-USDC are taken away (currently about 40976.47 dollars, it is estimated that it will probably reach 100000 dollars in a month), which will cause a fatal blow to the price of KTN and the growth of the entire project. Therefore, in the form of this email, I want to tell you that the invitation mechanism should be modified immediately. I hope Kostren.finance can continue to develop until the next bull market comes.
If this loophole really exists, I hope to get some rewards. I have been plagued by loans recently
Therefore, I urgently need a sum of income to fill the loophole. I hope to have follow-up contact, thank you.
